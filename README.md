# Welcome to Plantid

Plantid is a automatic watering system which works according the micro drip principle. The water will be pumped out a watertank through a 3,7V pump.
With the help of a PVC-pipe the water will be transported to the water sprinklers - which are in the earth next to the plants. The amount of water 
coming out of the sprinkler can be adjusted by turning the head. In addition there is a web application which monitors moisture level, temperature,
the state of the pump and the current watering time. The standard watering time is 10 seconds but can always be changed manually by the user in the
web application.
